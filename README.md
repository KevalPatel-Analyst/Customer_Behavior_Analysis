📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw data ingestion to final business insights. The goal of the project is to analyze the dataset, identify key trends and patterns, and present insights through an interactive dashboard and a clear business presentation.

The project covers data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL-based analysis, dashboard creation in Power BI, and reporting using Gamma.
